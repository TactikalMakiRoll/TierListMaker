## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Vue 3 (Composition API), Tailwind, Vite

## Optimizations

Would be great to implement defence against creating items with same name/image (quick and easy fix) and a dragover effect on every tier + sorting inside tiers to make the last added image be last in the list and possibility to change positions inside tiers, but I decided that I could create a Trello copy when I account for those right away. This was just a quick project for learning

## Lessons Learned:

Pointer and Mouse events can be changed to drag events and draggable attributes where most of the work is already done. Learned transferring images between components.
